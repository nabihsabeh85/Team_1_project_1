We imagined our client as a car dealership owner in India, who is in charge of choosing cars, setting prices, and marketing. Their goal is to increase sales and profit. The customers are people looking for good deals on used cars, considering price, condition, and overall satisfaction.

The used car market is changing rapidly, presenting challenges like choosing the right cars for inventory and pricing them to both attract customers and ensure profitability. The main goal is to find a balance: enough inventory to meet demand without tying up too much money in cars that don't sell quickly, and figuring out how to maximize profits.

To address these challenges, we gathered data on over 2,100 used cars sold in India over the past ten years. This data includes details like make, model, year, price, mileage, fuel type, and more, which will help in making informed decisions.

With our Python skills and various libraries, we cleaned this data, removing irrelevant information, and then used it to create graphs and analyses to guide our decisions.

MAKE VS. PRICE 
* Honda and Chevrolet are outliers in price, rest of the prices are relatively stabilized
* Average price for used cars is around 500,000 Rupees. Honda is around double. Chevrolet is slightly less

PRICE VS. MAKE YEAR
* The newer cars are more expensive, logic confirms
* 2015-2019 have the highest price range of cars and drops in 2020, likely due to drop in demand due to Covid

MAKE VS. PRICE GRAPH
* Four types of fuels, diesel is most expensive.
* Diesel range is from 300,000-650,000 INR, average is around 500,000 most common
* Only Slighter than CNG, average which is close to 400,000
* Petrol is lowest, average at around 350,000 most common
* LPG average is around 220,000, but also least used.

AUTOMATIC VS. MANUAL
* Manual Transmission type is favored by majority in India.
* Automatic makes up only 4.7% of used car owners.

OWNER TYPES
* First use car is majority of the pie at 63.2%, followed by second owner at 28%, totaling over 91.2%, less than 10% of people buy cars that were used more than twice.

MAX POWER VS. PRICE
* The more horsepower, the more expensive it is, positive correlation, direct relationship.
* 60-80 horsepower price range: 100,000-600,000
* 80-100 horsepower price range: 200,000-1,000,000
* 100 + horsepower price range: 400,000-1,200,000

CAR AGE VS. KM DRIVEN
* Cars made more recently were driven less
* Cars made 2010-2017, 10,000 to 100,000 km

AVERAGE PRICE & ODOMETER
* Negative correlation, the lower miles driven (odometer), the price stays higher.
* When you drive your car off the lot, the rate drops significantly.
* Confirms that the more used the car, the lesser the value 

SELLING PRICE VS. CAR AGE
* The older the car, the cheaper it is 

FUEL TYPE VS. MILEAGE
* Diesel is the most efficient gas of all 4
* CNG is almost just as efficient as Diesel but very few cars use it in India (compressed natural gas)
* LPG is the third most efficient (Liquefied Petroleum Gas)
* Petrol is the least efficient of the 4

ANALYSIS

1)	Risks

Changes in consumer preferences, especially due to economic shifts like those seen during the COVID-19 pandemic, can rapidly affect demand.
The increase of electric vehicles could disrupt existing preferences for traditional fuel types.


2)	Rationale 

The insights from the graphs recommend a strategy to prioritize inventory that aligns with consumer preferences for manual transmission, diesel fuel cars, and vehicles with fewer previous owners. Emphasizing newer models and those with lower mileage can also enhance the dealership's attractiveness and profitability.

3)	Solutions and suggestions: 

•	Focus on acquiring diesel, manual transmission vehicles that are newer and have lower mileage.
•	Implement pricing models that reflect the higher value of newer, less-used cars, and adjust prices based on fuel type efficiency and desirability.
•	Create a marketing Strategy that highlight the efficiency of diesel vehicles, the reliability of manual transmissions, and the value of purchasing cars with fewer previous owners in promotional materials.
•	Train your team to provide insights to buyers about the impact of car age, mileage, and fuel type on overall value and cost of ownership.

By adopting this data-driver approach, this dealership owner can enhance his inventory and pricing strategy, aligning closely with market demand and consumer preferences, thereby ensuring sustained profitability and customer satisfaction.
